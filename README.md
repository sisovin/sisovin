# Hi there, I'm Sisovin üëã

## About Me

I'm a passionate developer with a love for creating innovative solutions and exploring new technologies. I am particularly interested in programming languages, frameworks, and the use of artificial intelligence (AI) models provided by the Llama provider to support and enhance software development activities. This includes the development, deployment, and maintenance of applications.

## Technologies

### Programming Languages

Programming languages are the core tools used for software development. They provide a set of instructions that a computer can execute to perform a specific task. Some popular programming languages include:

- [ ] C
- [ ] C++
- [ ] C#
- [ ] JavaScript
- [ ] TypeScript
- [ ] Java
- [ ] Go
- [ ] Python
- [ ] Rust
- [ ] [Z]Zig
- [ ] Swift
- [ ] Ruby

### Frameworks and Libraries

Programming frameworks are collections of reusable code and libraries that provide a structure for building applications. They often include tools for tasks such as routing, templating, and database interactions. Some popular frameworks include:

- [ ] Node.js
- [ ] Vite
- [ ] Flutter
- [ ] Next.js
- [ ] React.js
- [ ] Laravel
- [ ] Asp.net Core and Blazor (Framework .NET 8 and Framework .Net 9)
- [ ] Angular
- [ ] Django
- [ ] Flask

### Databases

Databases are a crucial component of modern software applications, as they provide a centralized location for storing and managing data. Some popular databases include:

- [ ] MySQL
- [ ] SQL Server
- [ ] MongoDB
- [ ] PostgreSQL

### Llama Provider and AI Models

The Llama provider is a cloud-based AI service that offers a range of natural language processing (NLP) capabilities, including language translation, text generation, and sentiment analysis. Llama models can be integrated into various applications and services to provide AI-powered features.

When discussing the Llama provider and AI models in the context of programming languages and frameworks, the focus is on how these models can be used to:

- [ ] **Improve user experience**: By incorporating AI-powered chatbots, language translation, and text summarization into applications.
- [ ] **Enhance software development**: By providing tools for automated code review, bug detection, and recommendation of coding best practices.

### Other

- [ ] PHP
- [ ] .NET 8
- [ ] PostgreSQL
